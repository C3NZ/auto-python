# Automating EVERYTHING with python

## Description
Just a collection of all the snippets I modify or obtain from the book, python automation cookbook.

## Goals and Visions
1. Learn how to automate more things that I do in my life.
2. Learn more about the cooler things you can specifically use python for.

## How to run
Assuming you've cloned the repository and are in one of the sub directories
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

and then from there you can run any file that may exist within the directory.

## How to use
Use however you may. These snippets are pretty generalized, but in the event I like one of them so much i'll create
a separate repository for that code.

## Resources
No resources found so far.
